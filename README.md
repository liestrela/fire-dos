# fire-dos - Fire animation scene for DOS

This program runs a fire animation scene on 256-color VGA video on DOS, just for fun :)
It relies on DJGPP-implemented functions, so compile it with the DJGPP GCC cross-compiler (you will also need CWSDPMI, of course).

## Usage
- 'i': Increase fire;
- 'k': Decrease fire;
- 't': Toggle fire (on/off);
- 'q': Quit;
